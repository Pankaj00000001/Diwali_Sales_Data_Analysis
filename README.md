Diwali Sales Data Analysis Project

Overview

This project involves a detailed analysis of Diwali sales data using Python within a Jupyter Notebook environment. The objective is to extract valuable insights into product performance, customer behavior, and overall sales trends during the festive season.

Key Steps

	1. Data Collection:
	   •	Gathered sales data from diverse sources, including transaction records, customer information, and product details.
    
	2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
	   •	Cleaned the dataset by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and converting data types.
	   •	Preprocessed data to ensure suitability for analysis.
    
	3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
	   •	Conducted EDA to understand sales distribution, identify outliers, and explore correlations.
	   •	Visualized sales trends over time, emphasizing peak periods during Diwali.
    
	4. Product Performance Analysis:
	   •	Analyzed sales performance of individual products.
	   •	Identified top-selling products and assessed their contribution to overall revenue.
    
	5. Customer Segmentation:
	   •	Employed clustering techniques to segment customers based on Diwali purchasing behavior.
	   •	Explored patterns and preferences among different customer segments.
    
	6. Sales Channel Effectiveness:
	   •	Investigated the effectiveness of various sales channels during Diwali.
	   •	Visualized the impact of marketing strategies on sales.
    
	7. Predictive Modeling (Optional):
	   •	Developed predictive models to forecast sales for future Diwali seasons.
	   •	Evaluated model performance and provided recommendations for improvement.
